# More Civil SEO Audit – 31 Aug 2025

## Summary
- **Overall score:** 42/100 (confidence: medium)
- **Top risks:** missing structured data, no sitemap reference, weak metadata, slow page speed (no lab data), unoptimised images, thin content, poor internal linking, security headers incomplete, accessibility gaps, lack of local business signals.
- **Quick wins (<2h):** add sitemap line to robots, publish sitemap.xml, add canonical and social meta tags, embed LocalBusiness JSON-LD, compress images to WebP, preload hero image, ensure HSTS and referrer policy, add alt text to hero images, link home to core services, surface phone/NAP in footer.

## Technical
- robots.txt accessible and allows all bots but lacked sitemap line. Added `Sitemap: https://www.morecivil.au/sitemap.xml`.
- sitemap.xml missing. Created basic sitemap with 5 URLs.
- canonical tag absent; added to index.html.
- No evidence of 404/redirect rules; recommend standard 404 page and redirect non-www to www.
- Security headers from curl showed HSTS and X-Content-Type-Options but no CSP or Referrer-Policy.
- Rendering: React single-page app, heavy JS; no evidence of hydration errors but JS bundle likely large.

## On-Page
- Title and meta description generic; updated to target Adelaide water delivery and civil works.
- H1 hierarchy on service pages should emphasise primary keyword (e.g., "Water Delivery Adelaide").
- Alt text missing on some hero images; add descriptive text.
- Add FAQ sections with schema for each service page.

## Content
- Core service pages exist but thin on supporting content and proof (projects, testimonials, pricing details).
- No blog/FAQ content discovered; consider publishing location and service articles linking back to core pages.

## Links
- Internal linking shallow; homepage should link to water, dust suppression, tank fills, civil works.
- Created starter `link-map.csv` with priority links.
- No sitemap -> internal crawl depth unknown; generate full crawl post-deployment.

## Local SEO
- NAP not consistently displayed; ensure phone and service area on every page.
- Embed Google Map and link to Google Business Profile from contact page.
- Add `LocalBusiness` schema with address and service area (implemented on homepage).

## Core Web Vitals
- PageSpeed Insights API unavailable (quota); Lighthouse could not run in container. Assume LCP >4s from hero image and JS bundle; recommend image optimisation and code splitting.

## Schema
- Added `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD to homepage.
- Provided `schema-additions.json` with `Service` objects for key offerings.
- Recommend adding `Organization` and `WebSite` schema with SearchAction once domain settles.

## Competitor
| Aspect | morecivil.au | andyswater.com.au | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sitemap | now present | yes (wp-sitemap.xml) | parity |
| Structured data | minimal | Yoast Organization/Website | add matching schema |
| Content depth | thin | detailed service pages, blog | expand service copy |
| Page speed | unknown | WordPress, average | optimise bundle/images |
| Trust signals | few | testimonials & certifications | add testimonials, accreditation badges |
| Internal links | limited | well-linked service nav | build topic clusters |
| Local SEO | weak | clear NAP & map | add NAP + map |
| Schema for reviews/FAQ | none | often present | add FAQs & review schema |

### Catch-and-pass plan
1. Match competitor's service depth with detailed pages (500+ words) and case studies.
2. Add testimonials and accreditation images site-wide.
3. Publish regular blog posts targeting "water delivery Adelaide", "dust suppression SA" etc.
4. Implement FAQPage schema on services.
5. Optimise images to WebP/AVIF and preload hero.
6. Add HTTPS redirect and HSTS, configure CSP & Referrer-Policy.
7. Build internal links from blog/service area pages to core services.
8. Improve TTFB and LCP by leveraging HTTP/2 and caching.

## Fix Plan
See `seo/fixes/` for patch files:
- `meta-fixes.diff` – canonical, social meta, robots and sitemap.
- `schema-additions.json` – Service schema blocks.
- `link-map.csv` – proposed internal links.
- `preload-hints.patch` – preload hero image.
- `images-convert.sh` – WebP conversions.

## Appendix
- robots.txt: `seo/robots-more-civil.txt`
- sitemap headers: `seo/sitemap-more-civil.headers`
- competitor robots: `seo/robots-andyswater.txt`
- Lighthouse/PSI attempted but failed due to environment (no Chrome/Quota).
